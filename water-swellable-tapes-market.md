<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Swellable Tapes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conductive</li><li>Semi-Conductive</li><li>Non-Conductive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water swellable tapes market is divided into three key types based on their conductivity. Conductive tapes facilitate electrical current flow and are often used in applications requiring grounding or shielding. Semi-conductive tapes offer a balance, enabling limited conductivity for specific applications, such as in cable insulation. Non-conductive tapes, on the other hand, prevent electrical flow, making them suitable for moisture sealing without affecting electrical integrity. Each type serves distinct functions in industries like electrical, telecommunications, and construction.</p></p>
