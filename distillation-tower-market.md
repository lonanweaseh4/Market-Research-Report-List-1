<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distillation Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Batch"</li><li>"Continuous"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The distillation tower market is primarily divided into two types: batch and continuous. Batch distillation involves processing a specific quantity of liquid in discrete batches, allowing for high flexibility and control over the separation process. This method is ideal for small-scale production or varied product compositions. In contrast, continuous distillation operates non-stop, feeding in materials and extracting products simultaneously, which increases efficiency and throughput suitable for large-scale operations. Each type serves distinct industrial needs based on production requirements.</p></p>
