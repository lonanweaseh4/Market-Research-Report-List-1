<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrocautery Cautery Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrocautery cautery machines market is primarily categorized into unipolar and bipolar types. Unipolar electrocautery utilizes a single electrode, passing current through the patient’s tissue to perform cutting or coagulation, making it ideal for a wide range of surgeries. Bipolar electrocautery, on the other hand, employs two electrodes, generating heat only at the tips, which minimizes surrounding tissue damage and is suited for more precise procedures. Both types enhance surgical efficiency and reduce blood loss during operations.</p></p>
